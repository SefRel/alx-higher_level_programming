# Module in python
# A module in Python is a file containing Python code. This code can define functions, variables, and classes that you want to use in other Python files. Essentially, a module is a way to organize your code into separate files based on functionality.

Creating a Module:

Create a Python File: You create a module by writing Python code in a separate file. For example, let's create a file named my_module.py.

Define Functions/Variables/Classes:
In my_module.py, you can define functions, variables, or classes that you want to use elsewhere.

# my_module.py

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

PI = 3.14159
